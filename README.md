MPI Demos
=========

A collection of MPI demo programs to show various functionality.

####Disclaimer####
This is proof-of-concept only.  Do not expect this to scale well or work in any production scale.

common
------

Contains a set of high-level abstractions which make using the more complicated feature of MPI more palitable.

####MPI\_Connection\_Manager####

Stores MPI configuration information to hopefully make connecting easier.

####Socket####

Basic abstraction of the BSD Socket interface.  Mostly used internally.

connect-demo
------------

Creates several running sessions and connects them via the hydra nameserver.  This is very useful if you
have separate MPI instances running and you want to connect them together. I had problems getting the nameserver working
on OS X due to ssh and other quirks, so to avoid that, I pass the port info from `MPI_Open_port` via socket from the
Server to the Client.

More information can be found at the [MPICH Hydra Wiki][].

spawn-demo
----------

Takes an initial executable and spawns 3 other executables using `MPI_Comm_spawn` .
In addition, starts a signal handler such that if a program seg faults, then it will catch it, 
sending back a message to the main executable to have it respawn it.

####Usage Instructions####

    #  Run Spawn Demo
    ./scripts/run-spawn-demo.sh

Software Requirements
---------------------

+ __mpich__
+ __pthreads__



Compiling Demo Code
-------------------

The demo comes with an integrated build script which should be used before branching out on your own.

To see the help/usage, run

    ./build.sh -h

    usage: ./build.sh <flags>

    -h | --help    : Print usage instructions.
    -m             : Build software.
    -c             : Clean software.

By default, the build script will make the software.
